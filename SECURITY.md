# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub:
**[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk-js/security/advisories/new)**, in this
repository's **Security** tab.

Do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for a security problem.

Please include:

- the package version, and your runtime and its version (Node, Deno, Bun, Workers, ...)
- what an attacker can do, and under which conditions
- the smallest reproduction you can share, with no real keys or tokens in it
- whether you have told anyone else

## What happens next

- We aim to acknowledge a report within 5 business days, and to tell you then whether we can reproduce it.
- We fix confirmed issues in the latest minor release and publish a
  [GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk-js/security/advisories) with the
  fixed version. The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) lists the fix under **Security**.
- We credit reporters in the advisory unless you ask us not to.

Please give us a reasonable time to ship a fix before you disclose anything publicly.

## Supported versions

Only the latest minor release receives fixes, including security fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 0.9.x | yes |
| < 0.9 | no |

## Scope

In scope: the `witan-sdk` package on npm. Report problems with a WITAN origin (the hosted service) or with
the Python SDK the same way. We route them to the right maintainers.

Out of scope: problems that need an already-compromised machine or leaked keys, and reports produced only by
automated scanners with no demonstrated impact.

## Verifying a release

Every release is published by
[this repository's workflow](https://github.com/witanmarkets/witan-sdk-js/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
through npm Trusted Publishing, with provenance, without an npm token. Check an installed tree with:

```sh
npm audit signatures
```
